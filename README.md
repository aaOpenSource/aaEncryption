The pseudocode goes something like this.

1) Create some kind of random string
2) Instantiate the aaEncryption object, feeding it the random string as a seed value
3) Call the .EncryptString function to take a string and create an encrypted version of it
4) Call the .DecryptToString to take the encrypted value and decrypt it.
