============

[aaEncryption](http://archestranaut.avidsolutionsinc.com/2013/11/the-first-aaopensource-tool-aaencryption/)

The pseudocode goes something like this:

1. Instantiate the aaEncryption object, feeding it an optional random string as a seed value.
3. Call the .EncryptString function to take a string and create an encrypted version of it
4. Call the .DecryptToString to take the encrypted value and decrypt it.
